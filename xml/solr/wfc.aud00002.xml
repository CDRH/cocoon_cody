                Cody's Tribute to Edison

                
                    
                    

                    
                

                It is a great pleasure to see this wonder working man at his task and to find
                    that though he is super man to all the world, he is very human at home and among
                    those who labor with him.

                He has made the dynamo that has changed the world. It seems almost uncanny that
                    the voice in this place can be perpetuated and that he has set out to the world
                    his phonograph, which have given more entertainment and pleasure than any
                    invention in the history of the world.
