COL. CODY WANTS HIS INDIANS
Says They Are Not Demoralized By Traveling With Shows.

"Buffalo Bill," (Col. W. F. Cody) passed through Omaha today on his way to Washington to urge the Indian Commissioner to rescind his recent order prohibiting Indians from leaving the reservations to travel with shows.

Colonel Cody combats the argument used by the Commissioner that the Indians are demoralized by being out on the road with shows. He says the experiences they meet with in their travels better fit them to adopt the manners and customs of the white man than does life on the reservation. He says that the redskins are benefited rather than injured as members of traveling organizations which portray life on the plains.
