                Sentiments on the Cuba Question

                            
                                
                                 
                            

                The opponents of intervention have no substitute proposition. They have no plans
                    save those that have already failed. If the government were guided by their
                    advice, butchery, devastation, and barbarity would become permanent social
                    conditions in Cuba, and the unrest, the tumult, and the passion of the last
                    sixty days would take their places as established features of our national
                    life.
                No man who is not willing to hear about the hideous crimes in Cuba, to read the
                    war speeches of jingo Senators, and look upon the war headlines of the yellow
                    journals every day in the year for the remainder of their natural life has any
                    right to oppose intervention in Cuba unless he submits an effective plan for the
                    permanent abatement of these nuisances, which, in the language of the President,
                    have become intolerable.
                There is one more consideration. Any American who finds himself unable now to
                    support the president in his proposed policy towards Spain shows himself to be
                    perfectly content that this country should exhibit itself with an attitude of a
                    nation that will not fight for its peace and safety, for its honor and
                    self-respect, or in the performance of its duty imposed by humanity and
                    civilization.
                Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to introduce to you, a Congress of the Rough
                    Riders of the World.
