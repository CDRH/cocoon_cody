  Dear Captain.



  I presume you were informed by the Interior Dept.1 that I have permission for Indians. I am writing Shangrau. 2 And I don't wish to commence looking up Indians. Until I have your permission so if you see Shangrau will you please speak to him about it. I will not want the Indians much before May.  but its well to be letting them know. I will try my best to come after them my selfâ€”


  
  With my best wishes
  Yours truly
  W. F. Cody
  







Note 1: The Office of Indian Affairs, which administered Indian reservations, had been under civilian control as part of the Interior Department since 1849. 

Note 2: Probably John Shangreaux.
